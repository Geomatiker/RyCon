/**
 * This class is the entry point of the program.
 * <p>
 * This is used to show a nice name for Mac OS X users, because of at the moment there is
 * no Info.plist file used for RyCON. This is going to be changed in a nearby version.

 * <p>
 * Because of the fact that there are a lot of user who has java version 6 or 7
 * running, RyCON uses no functions of java version 8 in versions lower than 2.
