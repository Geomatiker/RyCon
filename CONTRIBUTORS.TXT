Contributors of RyCON
+------------------->

RyCON is not an one man show, rather a project with important contributors and their input!

I want to say thank you to:

 - the RyCON users who helped me with feedback, files and their endurance
 - all the little inputs from outside (number, icons, time, ...)

I have to be indebted to:

 - Christ Pesch from http://www.routeconverter.com for maven support and programming help. Not to take this for granted.
 - Sonja from http://swoony.de/ for their graphic design support and the beautiful icons of RyCON!

Some people more, some doesn't want to be mentioned.

Thank you so much. I appreciate this a lot!

Sebastian
